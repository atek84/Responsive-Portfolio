				<p id="bio-edit">The most challenging obstacle has to be throwing the paper tiger away. I have the confidence to excel but doubt has crept into my subconscious before and the fear alone is enough to slow me down. Iʼve spotted this before in the past and confronted it with good and bad results. The good far outweighs the bad so I am more familiar dealing with doubt than winning. Since the start of my coding journey I have felt an increase in confidence after a sharp lack in it but found a good motto out of it: perseverance is always a good substitute for a lack of natural talent. As long as I keep reminding myself this and not be too hard on myself I know Iʼll be able to graduate with my head held high.</p>
				<p>I've worked at restaurants for the last 13 years and I've done everything front of house that I wanted to achieve. I realized moving from being a busse to a server to a general manager that what's going to make me happy isn't really a high salary, it's the opportunity to build something and have a creative outlet to never settle or stay still. I love to grow and have been lucky to be in situations that I've created to learn what I truly value. I look forward to my future and expect struggles to make me a stronger, smarter and more well-rounded individual.</p>
